# KingKernel-stable
(c) KingKernel-stable by Kingbri and Sweezie

These builds are stable which means that they should run on your device 
However, this is a custom kernel, so there could be complications.

All changes are tracked via commits, a build that has x.x.1-9 is a maintainance build

If there are complications, post in XDA or in the telegram group here:
(It would be a faster response time through the TG group)
